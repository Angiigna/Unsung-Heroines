      <h1>Mission</h1>
      <p>
        In a realm veiled by mist and myth, you embark on a quest to bring light
        and liberation to your clan. Guided by ancient maps and whispered
        legends, you will uncover hidden heroines whose deeds have been woven
        into the fabric of history. Each parchment you find reveals the tale of
        a woman who defied the darkness of her age â€” and by learning,
        reflecting, and gathering their wisdom, you will earn enlightenment
        points that strengthen your people and illuminate the world. This
        journey is more than a quest; it is a path to awaken the forgotten
        voices of history and ignite the flame of knowledge within yourself.
